Class project for CS160

Help take attendance

# Changes made since presentation

## Attendance View

First, instead of coloring entire cells, we simply now have a button which represents the current attendance status. Since the table cells act as button, we changed the background to make these cells look more like buttons. Some people correctly realized that changing the status to excused would take three taps. Instead, you can now click the attendance square, and see all your options. 

Removed the idea of Roll Sheets, instead only supporting classes and students. 

Adding / Saving a note is now a two click process. Old way you had to
